Data Structure(s) Used: List [], strings

Description: This program will take a user specified file and and find
             all sets of words/numbers contained in prentheses and the 
             number of words in each set. Finally at the bottom of the
             output file, it will display the number of sets that were found

    @Description: Simple function used to write a header to a file
